## Introduction

1. The `mtcars` dataset is used
2. Task: using a logistic regression to determine the probability if a car fits the model
3. Parameter used for the model: horse power (hp) and weight (wt)

## Explanation

* User input: horse power (text input) and weight (slider)
* Prediction: the probability of the car having a manual transmission
* The output text based on the left panel
  * e.g. "The probability of the car being fitted with a manual transmission is about X%"

## Model

* Using a generalized linear model of the binomial 

```
{r chunk-1}
sum(1:10)
```
